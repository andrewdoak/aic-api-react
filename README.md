## Credits
This app would not have been possible without the amazing help from all of the below.
#### Per Scholas
Thank you to [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/) for living out its [mission](https://perscholas.org/about-per-scholas/) and providing the tuition-free tech training that has enabled me in so many ways.

Big thanks to Kat[Kat Saung](https://github.com/KatySaung/), my classmate, for helping without knowing she did. Some of the searches I tried based off of an informal discussion led to several UX and back end improvements. And thank you to my cohort at large. Discord people, you know.
#### LinkedIn Learning & Chicago Public Library
I used the [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/?u=116852650) platform and [Chicago Public Library's](https://www.chipublib.org) subscription to the service for research, reinforcement of React concepts, and to learn new things in building this app. I'll continue to do so as I further it. 

#### Per Scholas.
Thank you to the [Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/) for being a world-class institution in general, and specifically for the technology department for building such great resources that further its mission and making those resources publicly available and accessible, like the [API](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api) this app is built on.
